"""Export the honest upload backlog from a watermark store.

``pending_uploads`` MIN(queued_at)/COUNT(*) on the sigmond sink are
retention measures, not backlog: the wsprdaemon transport never
DELETEs rows, so a 24h trim timer pins those numbers regardless of
whether anything is actually stuck.  The watermark store's
``deliverables`` (retry-queue) and ``dead_letter`` tables — plus its
``watermarks`` (cursor) table — are the only place true backlog
lives.  This module reads them directly, read-only, and exports a
JSON-able summary for external monitoring.

``summarize()`` opens the sqlite file itself via a ``mode=ro`` URI
connection rather than instantiating ``SqliteWatermarkStore`` (whose
constructor runs ``CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`` and a best-effort
``chmod`` — both writes).  It queries the store's own tables
directly, so it works standalone against a bare copy of the db file
with no schema-init side effects and no write locks taken.

Failure handling is deliberately paranoid: on ANY error — missing
file, permission error, a directory at the path, a sqlite error, a
schema that doesn't look like a watermark store — ``summarize()``
returns ``{"readable": False, "reason": "<...>"}`` and never raises
and never fabricates zeros.  A monitoring consumer must be able to
tell "the store could not be read" apart from "the store was read
and genuinely has no backlog" (``{"readable": True, "pipelines": [],
"cursors": []}``); collapsing the two into the same zero is the exact
anti-pattern this module exists to kill.

    """Summarize deliverable/dead-letter backlog + cursors, read-only.

    Returns on success::

        {"readable": True,
         "pipelines": [{"name": <pipeline>, "deliverable_count": int,
                         "dead_letter_count": int}, ...],

                       "last_ack": ..., "cursor_len": int}, ...]}

    ``pipelines`` is derived from the distinct pipeline names present
    in the store's own ``deliverables`` and ``dead_letter`` tables (a
    union of both) — not from any external manifest — so a pipeline
    with only dead-letters (and no queued deliverables), or vice
    versa, still appears with the other count at 0. A pipeline with
    neither (e.g. one that has only ever shipped cleanly) does not
    appear at all; the ``cursors`` list is where its shipping state
    lives.

    ``cursors`` mirrors ``SqliteWatermarkStore.all_cursors()``
    exactly: same columns (``source_id``, ``dest_id``, ``table_name``,
    ``last_ack``, ``cursor_len``), same field names, same query. Do
    not treat this as a schema to hand-invent — it is read directly
    from ``sqlite.py``'s own query. ``last_ack`` is returned exactly
    as the store persists it: an ISO8601 string (see
    ``SqliteWatermarkStore.advance_cursor``'s ``last_ack`` param);
    this function does not parse or reformat it. ``cursor_len`` is
    the byte length of the opaque cursor blob, not the cursor itself.

    On any failure returns ``{"readable": False, "reason":
    "<ExceptionClassName>: <message>"}`` and never raises. This
    includes: missing file, a directory at the path, permission
    errors, sqlite corruption, and a file that opens but doesn't have
    the expected watermark-store schema (missing tables). An empty
    but well-formed store (freshly constructed
    ``SqliteWatermarkStore``, nothing shipped yet) is NOT a failure —
    it returns ``readable: True`` with empty lists. Callers must
    treat ``readable: False`` as "unknown", never as "zero backlog".
