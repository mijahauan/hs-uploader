"""Core types for hs-uploader.

The shape of the library is `Source -> Record -> Transport`, with a
``WatermarkStore`` persisting per-(source, destination, table) cursors and
retry deliverables.  Everything in this module is protocol-agnostic; the
concrete sources, transports, and watermark backends live in their
respective subpackages.

The public surface here is small on purpose: ``Record``, ``RecordBatch``,
``Outcome``, ``BatchPolicy``, ``RetryPolicy``, ``Pipeline``, ``Uploader``.
